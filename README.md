# travel-recommendation

This project aims to develop a travel guide recommendation system powered by a Large Language Model(LLM) for the city of Mysore, India. This system will dynamically suggest personalized travel plans based on the userâ€™s specific interests and preferences.

The project will also provide an optimized route for the users to travel between the recommended destinations so that they can minimize their travel time and maximize their enjoyment.
